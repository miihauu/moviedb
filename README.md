# moviedb

App uses external API to generate information about selected movie. 

That project was one of my first React projects. I've written it to get to know how to use external API and JS async concepts.
It is unfinished, so It is not presented in demo. It is just to show my code and the way how I wanted to built it. 


Technologies used:
- React,
- Axios,
- Autocomplete component
